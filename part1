# Setting Up Autopilot  

## Introduction

### Windows Autopilot is a cloud-based deployment service designed to simplify and automate device setup and configuration. By uploading a device's hardware hash into the Autopilot enrollment section, you can enable zero-touch deployment for new devices (directly from the manufacturer) or reset and reconfigure existing managed devices efficiently.
### Autopilot can be set up to ensure managed devices, such as laptops, automatically apply security policies, device configurations, and compliance requirements.
### I think of Autopilot as a recipe for setting up a Windows device. Instead of manually adding each ingredient (software, policies, settings), Autopilot applies the recipe automatically as soon as the device starts up.
